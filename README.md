### 1. Capture Overview

| **Property**      | **Value**             |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| **First Packet**  | `2021-10-14 06:10:51` |
| **Last Packet**   | `2022-02-17 01:12:33` |
| **Elapsed Time**  | `125 days, 20:01:41`  |
| **Total Packets** | `1,483`               |
| **Total Size**    | `255,216 bytes`       |

**Observation:**
The capture spans **125 days** but contains only **1,483 packets**. This is inconsistent with a continuously monitored production network and strongly suggests that the PCAP is a **compiled/sample capture**, likely created to demonstrate a variety of network **protocols and ports**. This is also consistent with the filename `protocols-and-ports.pcapng`.
